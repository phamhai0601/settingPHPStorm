Since it cannot build on top of the new JetBrains Shell plugin, it requires too much maintenance effort for what it adds. So after 10 years of development, <b>BashSupport has been retired</b>.\n\n<br><br>Due to this, BashSupport will not be ported to version 2020.2 and later. Existing versions stay available, so you can still use BashSupport with JetBrains IDEs 2020.1. Alternatively, to use equivalent features (<a href=\"https://www.bashsupport.com/plugin-comparison/\">and more</a>) with your JetBrains IDE, you can switch to the newly developed <a href=\"https://www.bashsupport.com/pro/\">BashSupport Pro</a>.\n\n<br><br>BashSupport Pro is <a href=\"https://www.bashsupport.com/pro/pricing/\">attractively priced</a> starting at 2.30 USD per month. To sweeten the transition:\n<ol>\n    <li>There is a 30-day <b>free trial</b>.</li>\n    <li>You get a <b>25% discount</b> on licences purchased before Oct 1, 2020. <a href=\"https://www.bashsupport.com/bashsupport-thanks/\">Use coupon code <b>BASHSUPPORT_THANKS</b>.</a></li>\n    <li>You can <b>re-use</b> your run configurations.</li>\n</ol>\n    ","tags":["Languages"],"vendor":"Joachim Ansorg","version":"1.8.0.202","notes":"\n        \n\n        <b>Changes in version 1.8.0.202:</b>\n        <ul>\n           <li>Retirement announcement for 2020.2 :(</li>\n        </ul><br>\n        \n        \n    ","dependencies":["com.intellij.modules.lang"],"since":"202.0","until":"202.*","sourceCodeUrl":"https://github.com/BashSupport/BashSupport","size":20697,"url":"https://www.bashsupport.com/"}
